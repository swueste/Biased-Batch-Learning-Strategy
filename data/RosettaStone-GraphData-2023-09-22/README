Digital Integrated Circuit Graph Data
SKY130-HS Rosetta Stone Data
2023-05-23  by Donghyeon Koh and W. Rhett Davis, NC State University

These files were generated with physical design of the Rosetta Stone
Netlist examples (https://github.com/ABKGroup/RosettaStone.git) 
for the Skywater 130nm process and High-Speed standard-cell 
library (sky130hs). 

The database-units-to-user-units (DBUtoUU) conversion factor
for this dataset is 1000.  Integer dimensions should be 
divided by this factor to get real dimensions in microns.

The file settings.csv contains the following settings for each variant:
CORE_UTILIZATION   - ratio of cell area to core area 
MAX_ROUTING_LAYER  - maximum allowed layer for routing (complete list
                     of layers is in counter_congestion.npz 'layerList')
CLK_PER            - clock period constraint (i.e. target) in units of ns
CLK_UNCERTAINTY    - clock uncertainty (currently 0.2 ns for all variants)
FLOW_STAGE         - Design flow stage at which the data was generated

There are 6 other settings relating to the layout of the power distribution
network, but these are fixed for all variants and can be ignored for now:
HSTRAP_LAYER, HSTRAP_WIDTH, HSTRAP_PITCH, VSTRAP_LAYER, VSTRAP_WIDTH,
and VSTRAP_PITCH
